# AI Sub Release Notes

## v2.8.2

This release ensures compatibility with the latest Gemini CLI tool for automated environments.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Gemini CLI Compatibility:** Added the `--skip-trust` flag to the Gemini CLI execution command. This ensures compatibility with the latest version of the tool, which requires explicit trust acknowledgement for non-interactive execution environments, preventing the pipeline from stalling.

## v2.8.1

This release improves the stability of the subtitle generation pipeline by relaxing the timestamp validation constraints.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Increased Validation Buffer:** Adjusted the default `validation_buffer_ms` from 1000ms to 2000ms in `AiSettings`. This provides additional headroom for AI models that frequently generate timestamps slightly exceeding the actual video segment duration, significantly reducing false-positive validation failures and redundant job retries.

## v2.8.0

This release promotes the Ollama web search integration to production, with significant improvements to prompt quality, dependency management, and validation flexibility.

**New Features:**

- **Ollama Web Search Tool:** Added support for Ollama as a web search provider, expanding the available search options beyond DuckDuckGo and builtin provider tools.
  - Introduced `OllamaWebSearchDeps` and `ollama_web_search_multi` function for web search.
  - Added `OllamaSearchSettings` configuration class with API key validation.
  - Updated `web_search_tool` option to include `'ollama'` alongside `'builtin'` and `'duckduckgo'`.
  - Refactored agent initialization to use `AsyncExitStack` for proper resource cleanup.

**Refactoring & Improvements:**

- **AgentDeps Architecture:** Introduced a new `AgentDeps` data model to centralize dependencies passed to Pydantic AI agents. This replaces the loose `Any` type with a typed, extensible container holding `video_duration_ms` and optional `ollama_search` fields.
  - Updated `RateLimitedAgentWrapper` to use typed `AgentDeps` instead of `Any`.
  - Refactored `ollama_web_search` functions to extract dependencies from `ctx.deps`.
  - Updated `main.py` to create and configure `AgentDeps` with Ollama search dependencies.
- **Rate Limiting Migration:** Implemented hook-based rate limiting.
  - Moved rate limiting logic from the `run()` method to model request hooks via a `_rate_limit` hook function.
  - Added token calculation helper `_calculate_tokens()` for accurate rate limit tracking.
  - Improved error message formatting to show human-readable durations.
- **Agent Constructor Updates:** Refactored both Gemini-cli and default Agent initialization to include capabilities (hooks) and `deps_type` (AgentDeps) to ensure that rate limits are enforced across all execution paths.
- **Deferred Response Validation:** Refactored response handling to store AI responses in a local variable, validate against video duration, and only assign to `job.response` if validation passes. This prevents storing potentially invalid responses on the job object.
- **In-Memory Caching for Ollama Search:** Added a cache to `OllamaWebSearchDeps` that stores search results keyed by a normalized query string (punctuation removed, case-folded). This avoids redundant API calls for equivalent queries like `"Hello, world!"` and `"hello world"`, reducing latency and API costs.

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Lyrics Detection (v7):** Updated `LYRICS_PROMPT_VERSION` to 7 with refined search rules that prioritize original composer names and native titles. Added concrete search query examples for Japanese covers, English covers, and original songs to improve search accuracy.
- **Ollama Search Prompt (v6):** Updated `LYRICS_PROMPT_VERSION` to 6 with refined instructions to prevent excessive search queries. Added explicit rules against query spamming, restrictive quotation marks, and guidance to use native titles for better search results.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Configuration Validation:** Updated config validation to only enforce an Ollama API key when the `web_search_tool` is set to `"ollama"` AND the thread lyrics flag is enabled (lyrics > 0). This allows for flexible configurations where Ollama search is configured but not actively used.
- **Gemini CLI Web Search Warning:** Previously, the Gemini CLI branch silently discarded `builtin_tools` and `function_tools` when `use_web_search` was `True`, meaning the configured `web_search_tool` was silently ignored. Now a `logfire.warn()` is emitted explaining that the tool will be skipped, and the agent is created without web search.
- **Developer Experience:** Added the Ollama API key registration link (`https://ollama.com/settings/keys`) to validation error messages, making it easier for users to configure their API keys.
- **Documentation:** Improved docstring clarity and type annotations across config, data models, models, job runner, main, ollama web search, prompt, and video modules. Updated to use modern Google-style format without redundant type hints in Args/Returns sections.
- **Documentation:** Fixed README to reference the correct split setting (`max-seconds` vs `max_minutes`).
- **Type Safety:** Added proper type annotations to validator methods and fixed field descriptions for rate limiters.

## v2.8.0b2

This release focuses on refactoring and hardening the Ollama web search integration introduced in v2.8.0b1, with improvements to rate limiting, dependency management, and prompt quality.

**New Features:**

- **In-Memory Caching for Ollama Search:** Added a cache to `OllamaWebSearchDeps` that stores search results keyed by a normalized query string (punctuation removed, case-folded). This avoids redundant API calls for equivalent queries like `"Hello, world!"` and `"hello world"`, reducing latency and API costs.

**Refactoring & Improvements:**

- **AgentDeps Architecture:** Introduced a new `AgentDeps` data model to centralize dependencies passed to Pydantic AI agents. This replaces the loose `Any` type with a typed, extensible container holding `video_duration_ms` and optional `ollama_search` fields.

  - Improved error message formatting to show human-readable durations.
- **Deferred Response Validation:** Refactored response handling to store AI responses in a local variable, validate against video duration, and only assign to `job.response` if validation passes. This prevents storing potentially invalid responses on the job object.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Ollama Search Prompt:** Updated `LYRICS_PROMPT_VERSION` to 6 with refined instructions to prevent excessive search queries. Added explicit rules against query spamming, restrictive quotation marks, and guidance to use native titles for better search results.
- **Developer Experience:** Added the Ollama API key registration link (`https://ollama.com/settings/keys`) to validation error messages, making it easier for users to configure their API keys.
- **Documentation:** Fixed README to reference the correct split setting (`max-seconds` vs `max_minutes`).

## v2.8.0b1

This release reverts the LyricsGenius integration introduced in v2.7.0 due to persistent bot detection issues, and introduces a new Ollama web search tool as an alternative search provider.

**Reverts:**

- **LyricsGenius Integration Removed:** Completely removed the LyricsGenius library and all associated code.
  - Removed `lyricsgenius_web_search.py` module and all Genius API integration.
  - Reverted `agent_wrapper.py` to use the DuckDuckGo search tool.
  - Updated configuration to support `'duckduckgo'` as the default `web_search_tool`.
  - Removed `lyricsgenius` dependency and restored `duckduckgo` in `pydantic-ai-slim`.
  - **Reason:** The LyricsGenius integration (v2.7.0) proved unreliable due to Genius and DuckDuckGo actively detecting and blocking automated requests, making lyrics retrieval consistently fail.

**New Features:**

- **Ollama Web Search Tool:** Added support for Ollama as a web search provider, expanding the available search options beyond DuckDuckGo and builtin provider tools.
  - Introduced `OllamaWebSearchDeps` and `ollama_web_search_multi` function for web search.
  - Added `OllamaSearchSettings` configuration class with API key validation.
  - Updated `web_search_tool` option to include `'ollama'` alongside `'builtin'` and `'duckduckgo'`.
  - Refactored agent initialization to use `AsyncExitStack` for proper resource cleanup.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Gemini CLI Web Search Warning:** Previously, the Gemini CLI branch silently discarded `builtin_tools` and `function_tools` when `use_web_search` was `True`, meaning the configured `web_search_tool` was silently ignored. Now a `logfire.warn()` is emitted explaining that the tool will be skipped, and the agent is created without web search.

## v2.7.0

This release introduces a significant enhancement to the lyrics detection pipeline by replacing generic web search with a specialized lyrics database integration, improving accuracy and search efficiency.

**New Features:**

- **LyricsGenius Integration:** Replaced the DuckDuckGo web search backend with the LyricsGenius library, providing direct access to the Genius database for more accurate and comprehensive lyrics retrieval.
  - **Specialized Search Tool:** Implemented `lyricsgenius_web_search_tool` as a dedicated search provider optimized for song and lyrics lookups.
  - **Intelligent Query Cleaning:** Added automatic removal of common LLM suffixes (e.g., "lyrics", "歌詞", "訳") that hurt search accuracy, ensuring cleaner and more effective queries.
  - **Structured Results:** Introduced new data models (`SearchResult`, `QueryResults`, `WebSearchResponse`) for better organization and type safety of search results.

**Removals:**

- **DuckDuckGo Search Removed:** Completely removed the DuckDuckGo web search option from the codebase. The `web_search_tool` configuration no longer supports `duckduckgo` as a provider, streamlining the search pipeline to focus exclusively on the superior LyricsGenius integration.

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Lyrics Detection (v5):** Updated the lyrics prompt to reflect the new search capabilities and provide clearer instructions on query optimization for the LyricsGenius tool.
- **Search Efficiency:** The prompt now explicitly instructs the AI to leverage the specialized search tool's capabilities without appending redundant keywords like "lyrics" to queries.

**Internal Tooling:**

- **Dependency Management:** Added `lyricsgenius` to project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Code Quality:** Maintained consistent Google-style docstrings and ruff formatting across all new modules.

## v2.6.1

This release focuses on hardening the subtitle generation pipeline by implementing configurable timestamp validation and improving data hygiene when handling AI responses.

**New Features:**

- **Configurable AI Timestamp Validation:** Added `validation_buffer_ms` to `AiSettings` (defaulting to 1000ms). This allows users to control how strictly generated timestamps are verified against video segment durations.
- **Hallucination Protection:** The system now explicitly validates AI-generated timestamps for both subtitles and scene detection against the video duration. This prevents the AI from generating content that extends beyond the actual media length.

**Refactoring & Improvements:**

- **Automated Timestamp Sanitization:** Introduced Pydantic "before-validators" and a new `_clean_timestamp_string` utility. This allows the system to gracefully handle "field leakage" in LLM responses—such as extracting `03:52.000` from noisy strings like `03:52.000,start:`—before data is assigned to model fields.
- **Improved Data Hygiene:** Re-engineered the `Subtitles` and `Scene` data models to ensure they store only sanitized timecodes, improving internal consistency and reducing downstream parsing errors.
- **Validation Pipeline Hardening:** Updated `Job.load` and internal runners to propagate validation context. This ensures that even cached results are re-validated against current duration limits and buffer settings.
- **Strict Parsing:** Refactored the core timestamp parser to enforce strict formats, delegating noise removal to the pre-validation layer.

**Internal Tooling:**

- Transitioned the project's formatting and linting from `black` to `ruff` for a faster and more integrated developer experience.

## v2.6.1b3

This release focuses on hardening the lyrics detection stage against AI formatting errors and improving the efficiency of the web search pipeline.

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Lyrics Detection (v4):**
  - **JSON Syntax Guard:** Introduced a critical safety layer to prevent "field leakage," where the AI might accidentally include JSON keys or structural markers inside string values.
  - **High-Efficiency Search:** Re-engineered the execution pipeline to explicitly mandate simultaneous, multi-query web searches. This significantly reduces the number of AI turns required, lowering both latency and API costs.
  - **Structured Output Format:** Refined the prompt's output block to provide a clearer template for the model, ensuring consistent JSON generation.

**Backend & Validation:**

- **Robust Timestamp Parsing:**
  - Refactored `_parse_timestamp_string_ms` to use regular expressions. This allows the system to successfully extract valid timecodes even if the AI response contains "noisy" prefixes or suffixes (e.g., `"01:23.456,start:"`) within the timestamp field.
- **Data Model Enhancements:**
  - **Original Language Tracking:** Added a dedicated `original_language` field to the `Scene` model to better capture and track the primary language of detected songs.
  - **Scene Integrity:** Implemented a Pydantic `model_validator` for the `Scene` class, ensuring that all detected scenes maintain chronological integrity (start time must be strictly before end time) before processing continues.

**Bug Fixes:**

- Fixed an issue where "field leakage" in AI responses could lead to JSON validation failures.

## v2.6.1b2

This release refines the AI prompting strategy to improve formatting reliability and better handle visual-only cues.

**Prompt Engineering:**

  - **Simplified Pipeline:** Streamlined the metadata resolution steps for improved efficiency.
- **Subtitle Generation (v15):**
  - **Dual-Trigger System:** Clarified that subtitles are triggered by both vocal audio and prominent on-screen text.
  - **Visual Events Exception:** Explicitly instructs the AI to subtitle relevant visual text (like chapter titles) even when no audio is present.
  - **Anti-Hallucination Hardening:** Strengthened rules for ignoring incorrect or incomplete reference data and mandated manual transcription when the JSON reference fails.
  - **Standardized Analysis:** Updated examples to use a consistent, structured `global_analysis` format.
  - **New Visual Text Example:** Added a dedicated example for handling silent title cards.

**Backend & Validation:**

- **Timestamp Validation:**
  - Refactored timestamp parsing into an internal utility function `_parse_timestamp_string_ms`.
  - Implemented Pydantic `model_validator` on both `Subtitles` and `Scene` models to verify timestamp format and ensure the start time is strictly before the end time.
  - Improved robustness against malformed AI-generated strings (e.g., truncated JSON noise in timestamp fields).
- **Static Analysis Fixes:**
  - Resolved `CliPositionalArg` to `Path` type mismatch for static analysis.
  - Added explicit type casting in `config.py` and `main.py` to address errors where `CliPositionalArg` was not assignable to `Path` for methods like `.resolve()`, `.stem`, and `.name` in Pyright/mypy.

## v2.6.1b1

This release focuses on hardening the AI's transcription logic and translation accuracy by introducing stricter boundaries for reference data and expanding the contextual window for translations.

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Subtitle Generation (v14):**
  - **The Manual Transcription Mandate:** Explicitly instructs the AI that it is "not exempt" from subtitling if the reference JSON is null or mismatching; it must rely on native audio perception to transcribe.
  - **Strict Scene Boundaries:** Added rules to prevent "cross-contamination" where lyrics from a later scene in the reference JSON are incorrectly applied to earlier audio.
  - **Enhanced Contextual Window:** Refined the translation logic to mandate analysis of the **Previous 2 Sentences** and **Next 2 Sentences** to improve pronoun resolution and tonal consistency.
  - **Refined Anti-Hallucination:** Updated the "Wrong Song" and "Partial Video" scenarios with specific timestamp-based examples to help the model ignore irrelevant reference data.
  - **Improved Decoding Hierarchy:** Streamlined the fallback logic for resolving ambiguous audio, prioritizing visual OCR and scene context.

## v2.6.0

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Subtitle Generation (v13):**
  - **Anti-Drift Mechanics:** Introduced strict "mechanical rules" to solve the "Cascading Delay" effect where subtitles fall behind the audio.
    - **The Sacred Start Time:** Forces the model to anchor start timestamps strictly to audio onsets, regardless of previous line lengths.
    - **Truncation over Extension:** Mandates aggressive truncation of end timestamps to ensure upcoming lines start on time.
    - **Instantaneous Transitions:** Enforces zero-gap transitions for rapid-fire speech.
  - **New Rapid Speech Example:** Added a dedicated prompt example demonstrating how to handle high-speed vocals without synchronization loss.
  - **Verification Logic:** Updated the required `global_analysis` to force the AI to acknowledge audio pacing and its truncation strategy before generating subtitles.

## v2.5.0

This release promotes the v2.5.0 beta series to production, finalizing the migration to a fully asynchronous architecture. It includes significant stability improvements to the job runner, improved resource management for concurrent tasks, and critical fixes for blocking I/O operations.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Async Stability & Performance:**
  - **Job Runner Safety:** Refactored the `JobRunner` loop to ensure `queue.task_done()` is always called, preventing deadlocks if an exception occurs during job setup.
  - **Blocking I/O:**
    - Offloaded synchronous video file reading in `RateLimitedAgentWrapper` to a thread to prevent blocking the event loop.
    - Moved the CPU-intensive `get_ssafile()` call in `main.py` to a worker thread during post-processing.
  - **Windows Process Management:** Fixed an issue where the `taskkill` command used for timeouts in `GeminiCliModel` was not properly awaited.

- **Refactoring:**
  - **JobRunner Encapsulation:** The `JobRunner` class now manages its own `asyncio.Queue`, simplifying the main orchestration logic.
  - **Async Start:** `JobRunner.start()` is now an `async` method, ensuring it executes within the correct event loop context.
  - **Optimization:** `reencode_video` now uses `asyncio.gather` for parallel duration checks of input and output files.

- **Resource Management:**
  - **Concurrency Limits:** Implemented a semaphore (limit: 8) for concurrent `ffprobe` duration checks to prevent "Too many open files" errors.

- **Bug Fixes:**
  - **Gemini File Uploader:** Fixed a runtime error by using `async for` when iterating over file lists.
  - **Data Integrity:** Enforced strict zipping of video split paths and durations in `main.py` to fail immediately if list lengths mismatch.

## v2.5.0b1

This release marks a major architectural shift, migrating the core application from a threaded model to a fully asynchronous model using `asyncio`. This improves concurrency handling, reduces blocking operations, and enhances overall stability.

**Refactoring (Asyncio Migration):**

- **Core Architecture:**
  - Transitioned `JobRunner` and the main orchestration loop from `concurrent.futures` and threading to `asyncio.Queue` and `asyncio.Task`.
  - The application entry point now utilizes `asyncio.run()`.
- **Non-Blocking I/O:**
  - **Video Processing:** Converted FFmpeg calls (`split`, `re-encode`, `duration`) to use `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`.
  - **Gemini Integration:** `GeminiFileUploader` now uses the asynchronous `google.genai.Client`. CPU-intensive tasks like SHA256 hashing are offloaded to threads.
  - **CLI Execution:** `GeminiCliModel` now uses async subprocesses for model execution and offloads prompt file writing to threads.
  - **File Operations:** Heavy synchronous I/O operations (loading job states, reading video bytes, stitching subtitles) are now offloaded using `asyncio.to_thread` to keep the event loop responsive.
- **Agent Execution:**
  - Refactored `RateLimitedAgentWrapper` to use native async methods, removing the need for `nest_asyncio` and thread-local storage.

**Improvements:**

- **Parallelization:** Video duration checks in the splitting stage are now executed in parallel using `asyncio.gather`.
- **Windows Stability:** Fixed a blocking I/O issue where the taskkill command (used for timeouts) relied on synchronous subprocess calls, which could freeze the event loop.

**Internal Changes:**

- Removed the `nest_asyncio` dependency.
- Fixed type safety for `HttpOptions` in the GenAI client initialization.

## v2.4.1

This release fixes a configuration issue where nested settings were ignoring the `.env` file.

**Fixes:**

- **Configuration (.env loading):**
  - Fixed an issue where `AISUB_AI_GOOGLE_KEY` and other nested variables in `.env` were not being loaded because nested Pydantic models do not inherit configuration from the parent Settings class.
  - Defined `_BASE_CONFIG` with `env_file=".env"` and applied it to all nested `BaseSettings` models (`GoogleAiSettings`, `GeminiCliSettings`, `AiSettings`, etc.) to ensure consistent behavior.

## v2.4.0

This release promotes the v2.4.0 beta series to production, incorporating all stability fixes, prompt engineering enhancements, and configuration improvements introduced in the beta cycle.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Documentation:**
  - Updated the README to clarify the current free request limits for the Gemini CLI.

**Known Issues:**

- **Asyncio Event Loop:**
  - Users may see errors like `RuntimeError: <asyncio.locks.Event object ...> is bound to a different event loop`.
  - This is currently under investigation. The application will automatically retry the affected job, so these errors can be ignored.

## v2.4.0b5

This release enhances configuration robustness, improves prompt engineering for subtitles, and updates documentation for clarity.

**New Features:**

- **Configuration (API Key Sanitization):**
  - The application now automatically strips leading/trailing whitespace and surrounding quotes from the Google AI API key during configuration loading. This prevents common authentication failures caused by copy-paste errors or shell quoting.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Configuration (API Key Validation):**
  - Fixed an issue where a Google API key was required even when lyrics processing was disabled (`--thread.lyrics=0`). The API key is now only validated if the lyrics stage is active, allowing for API-key-free workflows when using `gemini-cli` for subtitles.
- **Gemini CLI (Cost Calculation):**
  - Resolved a `CostCalculationFailedWarning` by ensuring the `model_name` is correctly passed to `pydantic-ai`'s instrumentation layer, enabling accurate cost tracking for CLI-based executions.
- **Upload (Logging):**
  - Added debug logging for the full file object details returned by the Gemini Files API after a successful upload, aiding in troubleshooting.

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Subtitle Generation (v12):**
  - Incremented `SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION` to 12.
  - The prompt has been significantly enhanced with stricter guidelines to improve accuracy:
    - **The "Golden Rule":** Reinforces that audio dictates timing ("When") while visuals and context dictate content ("What").
    - **Decoding Hierarchy:** Establishes a clear fallback order (On-screen Text > Scene Context > Reference JSON) for resolving ambiguous audio.
    - **Anti-Hallucination Rules:** Added robust logic to handle scenarios where the reference JSON contains lyrics for the wrong song or extra verses not present in the video segment.
    - **Timestamp Alignment:** Introduced stricter rules to prevent "cascading delay" errors by ensuring end timestamps tightly wrap the spoken audio, disabling readability biases that could cause sync issues.
    - **Pause Handling:** Mandates splitting subtitles across audible pauses to maintain precise synchronization.

**Documentation:**

- **README Update:** The main `README.md` has been updated with a clearer overview and revised usage instructions, including the latest recommendations for free-tier models.
- **Configuration File:** The detailed `CONFIGURATION.md` has been moved from the root directory to the `docs/` folder for better project organization.

## v2.4.0b4

This release fixes critical bugs related to concurrent processing and file path handling, significantly improving stability and compatibility, especially when using the Gemini CLI backend.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Async Stability (Per-Thread Agent Caching):**
  - Fixed a `RuntimeError` related to `asyncio` event loops that occurred during concurrent agent execution.
  - The issue was caused by creating new AI Agent instances on every call within a worker thread, leading to event loop conflicts.
  - The fix now caches a single `Agent` instance per thread using `threading.local()`. This ensures stability by aligning the agent's lifecycle with the thread's event loop and improves performance by reusing the agent and its connection pool.
- **File Path Resolution (Gemini CLI):**
  - Resolved a `ValueError: relative path can't be expressed as a file URI` that occurred when using the `gemini-cli` backend.
  - All relevant file paths (`input_video_file`, `dir.out`, `dir.tmp`) are now resolved to absolute paths upon configuration load, ensuring compatibility with tools that require absolute file URIs.

## v2.4.0b3

This release improves agent execution stability and compatibility by refining asynchronous operations.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Async Stability:**
  - **Agent Execution:** Replaced manual `asyncio.run()` with `pydantic-ai`'s built-in `run_sync()` method. This avoids potential `RuntimeError` issues when the agent is invoked from a thread with a running asyncio event loop and simplifies the code.
  - **Event Loop Nesting:** Implemented `nest_asyncio` to patch the asyncio event loop. This allows for nested execution, ensuring compatibility with environments like Jupyter notebooks or web servers where an event loop is already active.

## v2.4.0b2

This release significantly hardens the application architecture, improving state management security, data integrity during processing, and Gemini CLI integration. It also reorganizes the documentation for better accessibility.

**Documentation:**

- **Configuration:** Moved all configuration flags to a dedicated [`CONFIGURATION.md`](CONFIGURATION.md) file to declutter the main README.
- **New Settings:** Added documentation for the `duration-tolerance-ms` setting.

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Gemini CLI Integration:**
  - Refactored the Gemini CLI wrapper into a formal `pydantic_ai.models.Model`.
  - Added automatic instrumentation for `logfire`, allowing capture of token usage and latency metrics from CLI-based executions.
- **Data Integrity:**
  - **Video Splitting:** `split_video` now calculates the total duration of existing segments to verify integrity before skipping the split operation.
  - **Re-encoding:** `reencode_video` now compares the duration of existing output files against the input (with a configurable `duration_tolerance_ms`) to ensure validity.
- **Optimization:** Job runners now check for existing valid responses in the job object before processing, preventing unnecessary API calls.

**Fixes:**

- **Asyncio Stability:** Fixed a `RuntimeError` by ensuring the AI agent and its underlying HTTP client are initialized within the active `asyncio` event loop.
- **Security & Privacy:**
  - **State Sanitization:** The `file` attribute is no longer saved to the JSON state files, preventing the persistence of absolute file paths (which may contain sensitive usernames).
  - **Resumption Logic:** Updated the pipeline to correctly handle job resumption when file handles are missing from the state.
- **Type Safety:** Added runtime assertions in job runners to satisfy type checkers regarding optional file paths.

**Refactoring:**

- **Data Models:**
  - Renamed `JobState` to `SegmentJobs` to better reflect its purpose.
  - Renamed `SceneResponse` to `LyricsSceneAiResponse` and merged `SubtitleResponse` into `SubtitleAiResponse`.
  - Simplified `SegmentJobs` to use optional fields instead of dictionaries.
- **Pipeline:**
  - Centralized pipeline stage completion callbacks into a single `on_stage_complete` function.
  - Simplified the main orchestration logic in `main.py` to use a linear dependency chain.
- **Code Cleanup:** Removed unused data models (`AiResponse`, `SubtitleGenerationState`) and redundant fields.

## v2.4.0b1

This release introduces significant improvements to prompt engineering for better accuracy, adds support for DuckDuckGo search, and allows for disabling the lyrics detection pass. It also includes architectural refactoring to improve stability and support mixed-model workflows.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

- **Web Search Configuration:**
  - The option `google` has been renamed to `builtin` to be provider-agnostic.
  - The default search tool is now `duckduckgo` instead of `builtin` (Google).

**New Features:**

- **DuckDuckGo Search:** Added support for DuckDuckGo as a web search provider. This is now the default setting to avoid costs associated with Google's built-in search tool when using the API.
- **Optional Lyrics Detection:** The lyrics and scene detection pass can now be disabled by setting `--thread.lyrics 0`. This allows for a transcription-only workflow, saving time and API costs.

**Prompt Engineering:**

- **Lyrics & Scene Detection (v2):**
  - **Granular Metadata:** The model now explicitly separates the "Original Artist" from the "Video Performer" and includes a step-by-step search log.
  - **Improved Search:** Search queries have been optimized with specific templates to improve hit rates for lyrics.
- **Subtitle Generation (v11):**
  - **The "Golden Rule":** Introduced strict logic where audio strictly dictates _timing_ ("When"), while visuals and context dictate _content_ ("What").
  - **Anti-Hallucination:** Added strict rules to handle cases where the reference lyrics are for the wrong song or contain extra verses not present in the video segment.
  - **Ambiguity Resolution:** Clarified the hierarchy for resolving ambiguous audio (On-screen text > Scene Context > JSON).

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Resumption Stability:**
  - Fixed an issue where resuming a job with expired Gemini cloud files (older than 48 hours) would fail. The system now forces a re-check and re-upload if necessary.
  - Fixed a `RuntimeError` related to asyncio event loops by lazily initializing the AI Agent.
- **Mixed Provider Support:**
  - Fixed file path handling when using a Google model for lyrics detection and a non-Google (e.g., local or different API) model for subtitle generation.
  - Ensure `WebSearchTool` is correctly enabled for API-based lyrics detection.
- **Internal Refactoring:**
  - Decoupled `JobRunner` from the `Job` structure for better pipeline flexibility.
  - Centralized job logging and error handling.

## v2.3.1

This release improves exception handling in logging and adds a fail-safe to the file uploader.

**Fixes & Improvements:**

- **Logging:**
  - Replaced `logfire.error` with `logfire.exception` in `gemini_cli_wrapper.py` and `video.py` to ensure stack traces are properly captured within the active span before an exception propagates.
  - Removed redundant exception details from log messages, allowing `logfire.exception` to handle context automatically.
- **File Uploader:**
  - Added a fail-fast check for `FileState.FAILED` in `gemini_file_uploader.py` to prevent an infinite loop while waiting for a file to be processed by the server.

## v2.3.0

This release removes the two-pass subtitle generation system in favor of a simpler, single-pass workflow. The second "QA" pass proved to be of limited value and added unnecessary complexity and cost.

**BREAKING CHANGES:**

- **Configuration:**
  - The `ai.pass1_model` and `ai.pass2_model` settings have been removed and replaced with a single `ai.model_subtitles`.
  - The `ai.lyrics_model` setting has been renamed to `ai.model_lyrics`.
  - The `thread.subtitles1` and `thread.subtitles2` settings have been consolidated into `thread.subtitles`.
  - The `ai.model` shorthand now sets `model_subtitles` and `model_lyrics`.
- **State Persistence:** The format for intermediate job state files has changed.
  - `part_XXX.pass1.MODEL.json` is now `part_XXX.subtitles.MODEL.json`.
  - `part_XXX.pass2.MODEL.json` is no longer created.
  - **You must delete temporary directories (e.g., `tmp_<video_name>`) from previous runs before using this version.**

**Improvements:**

- **Simplified Pipeline:** The subtitle generation process is now a single AI call, reducing complexity, processing time, and potential points of failure.

- **Prompt Versioning & Auto-Reprocessing:**
  - Introduced versioning for both the "Lyrics/Scene Detection" prompt (`LYRICS_PROMPT_VERSION`) and the "Subtitle Generation" prompt (`SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION`).
  - The application now automatically detects when a prompt has been updated between runs. It will invalidate cached results for affected segments and re-process them using the new prompt, ensuring subtitles always reflect the latest logic.
  - Cache loading is now more robust. Corrupted or outdated job files from previous runs are automatically ignored and re-processed, preventing crashes.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Updated `SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION` to 10.
  - The subtitle generation prompt has been significantly improved with a "Decoding Hierarchy" to better handle ambiguous audio by prioritizing on-screen text and reference JSON.
  - Added stricter rules to prevent "cascading delay" timing errors and to enforce intelligent segmentation.

## v2.2.0b1

This release introduces a major refactoring of the job processing pipeline to be more flexible and robust, improves state persistence, and refines the QA prompt to better handle timing errors.

**BREAKING CHANGE:**

- The persistence format for intermediate job states has changed from multiple files per segment to a single `part_XXX.json` file. In-progress jobs from previous versions are not compatible. **You must delete temporary directories (e.g., `tmp_<video_name>`) from previous runs before using this version.**

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Pipeline Rearchitecture & Multi-Model Reruns:**
  - The pipeline now uses a central `JobState` object that stores results for each stage (`lyrics`, `pass1`, `pass2`) in a dictionary keyed by the model name.
  - This enables re-running a specific stage with a different model (e.g., using a more powerful model for Pass 2) without reprocessing the entire pipeline.
- **Robust State Persistence & Resumption:**
  - **Unified Persistence:** The state for each video segment is now saved to a single `part_XXX.json` file, making state management and job resumption more reliable.
  - **Intelligent Resumption:** The processing loop now intelligently inspects the state file to determine which stage to execute next based on the models configured for the current run.
  - **File Existence Validation:** The resumption logic now verifies that the video files for completed stages still exist, preventing errors if intermediate files are deleted.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Updated `SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION` to 9.
  - The Pass 2 (QA) prompt has been significantly updated to prioritize fixing timestamp desynchronization ("Timestamp Drift"), instructing the AI to re-anchor subtitles to the correct audio position.

**Bug Fixes:**

- **Video Duration Calculation:** Fixed an issue where a failure to get a video's duration would result in a silent error and a value of `0`. This led to corrupted timestamp offsets in the final subtitle file. The function now raises a `RuntimeError` to fail fast.

**Code Improvements:**

- **Data Model Refactoring:** The `SubtitlePass1Job` and `SubtitlePass2Job` models have been simplified. The job runners now retrieve prerequisite data (like scene information and Pass 1 drafts) directly from the central `JobState` object, creating a cleaner and more efficient data flow.

---

## v2.1.0b3

This release improves the robustness of subtitle generation when the lyrics reference is inaccurate or missing.

**Improvements:**

- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Updated `SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION` to 7.
  - Refined Pass 1 and Pass 2 prompts to handle cases where the lyrics reference is missing, incomplete, or incorrect. The AI is now explicitly instructed to prioritize the audio source of truth over the reference JSON if discrepancies exist, preventing it from forcing audio to fit an incorrect lyric sheet.

---

## v2.1.0b2

This release refines the scene detection pass to reduce false positives for lyrics research by ignoring instrumental background music.

**Improvements:**

- **Scene Detection:**
  - Renamed the `contains_song` field to `contains_vocal_music` to explicitly target songs with vocals.
  - Updated the scene detection prompt to instruct the AI to ignore instrumental-only tracks and background music (BGM). This prevents unnecessary web searches for lyrics when no vocals are present.
- **Prompt Versioning:**
  - Incremented `SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION` to 6.

---

## v2.1.0b1

This release introduces a new "Scene Detection & Lyrics Research" pass to the pipeline, further enhancing contextual accuracy, especially for videos containing music.

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Scene Detection & Lyrics Research Pass:** A new initial pass has been added to the processing pipeline.
  - It analyzes the video to identify distinct scenes (e.g., dialogue vs. music).
  - For scenes containing music, it uses the AI's web search capabilities to find official original and translated lyrics.
- **Context-Aware Subtitle Generation:** The data from the new scene/lyrics pass is fed into both Pass 1 (Drafting) and Pass 2 (Refinement). This provides the AI with crucial context, improving the accuracy of lyric transcription and translation.
- **New Configuration:**
  - `ai.lyrics_model`: A new setting to specify the model for the scene detection pass.
  - `thread.lyrics`: A new setting to control concurrency for this pass.
- **Updated Pipeline Flow:** The processing pipeline is now: Lyrics and Scene Detection -> Subtitle Pass 1 -> Subtitle Pass 2.

**Code Improvements:**

- **Pipeline Orchestration (`main.py`):** The main pipeline logic has been updated to incorporate the new scene detection job runner and manage the new data flow.
- **Data Models (`data_models.py`):** Introduced `LyricsSceneJob`, `Scene`, and `SceneResponse` models to handle the data from the new pass. `SubtitlePass1Job` and `SubtitlePass2Job` now include an optional `scene_response`.
- **Response Models (`data_models.py`):** Split the generic `AiResponse` into specific `SubtitlePass1Response` and `SubtitlePass2Response` models. This ensures that the output from each pass strictly adheres to its expected schema (e.g., `global_analysis` for Pass 1, `qa_analysis` for Pass 2).
- **Prompt Engineering (`prompt.py`):** Prompts for Pass 1 and Pass 2 have been updated to consume and utilize the new scene and lyrics reference data.

---

## v2.0.0

This major release introduces a two-pass subtitle generation workflow to significantly improve subtitle quality, accuracy, and refinement.

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Two-Pass Subtitle Generation:** The core subtitle generation process has been re-architected into a two-pass system:
  - **Pass 1 (Draft Generation):** The first pass generates an initial draft of the subtitles. This is handled by the new `SubtitlePass1JobRunner` and configured with `ai.pass1_model` and `thread.subtitles1`.
  - **Pass 2 (QA & Refinement):** The second pass takes the JSON output from Pass 1 as a draft and performs quality assurance, correction, and refinement using a separate, specialized prompt. This is handled by the new `SubtitlePass2JobRunner` and configured with `ai.pass2_model` and `thread.subtitles2`.
- **Improved Modularity:** This new architecture allows for using different AI models for each pass (e.g., a faster model for the initial draft and a more powerful model for refinement).

**Breaking Changes & Refactoring:**

- **Configuration (`config.py`):**
  - The `ai.model` setting has been replaced by `ai.pass1_model` and `ai.pass2_model`. An optional `ai.model` shorthand is available to set both to the same value.
  - The `thread.subtitles` setting has been split into `thread.subtitles1` and `thread.subtitles2` to configure concurrency for each pass independently.
- **Main Pipeline (`main.py`):**
  - The main application logic has been significantly updated to orchestrate the new two-pass workflow, managing separate job queues and runners for each pass.
  - Job resumption logic now checks for the state of both passes to correctly resume interrupted sessions.
- **Data Models (`data_models.py`):**
  - `SubtitleJob` has been renamed to `SubtitlePass1Job`.
  - A new `SubtitlePass2Job` has been introduced to manage the state and data for the refinement pass.
- **Agent Wrapper (`agent_wrapper.py`):**
  - The `RateLimitedAgentWrapper` is now initialized with a specific model name, enabling the use of different models for each generation pass.

- **Gemini CLI Configuration:** Added `overwrite_system_prompt` to `GeminiCliSettings`. This setting determines whether to overwrite the system prompt using `GEMINI_SYSTEM_MD` or pass the prompt as a regular file argument.

**Code Improvements:**

- **GeminiCliWrapper Refactor:** Refactored `GeminiCliWrapper` to accept the full `GeminiCliSettings` object and removed unused imports and testing code.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlippFuzz/ai-sub/compare/v1.11.0...v1.12.0

---

## v1.11.0

This release updates the subtitle generation prompt to improve timing accuracy and synchronization.

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Prompt Update:** Updated `SUBTITLES_PROMPT` to version 3. The guidelines now strictly prioritize native audio alignment, explicitly disabling readability biases. This fixes an issue where the AI model would extend timestamps for readability, resulting in cascading delays in subtitle timings.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlippFuzz/ai-sub/compare/v1.10.1...v1.11.0

---

## v1.10.1

This release fixes a critical issue preventing the application from starting when installed via pip.

**Bug Fixes:**

- **Script Entry Point:** Encapsulated the application startup logic within a `main()` function in `ai_sub.main`. This resolves an `ImportError` where the `ai-sub` command (defined in `pyproject.toml` as `ai_sub.main:main`) failed to find the `main` function because the logic was previously contained solely within an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlippFuzz/ai-sub/compare/v1.10.0...v1.10.1

---

## v1.10.0

This release introduces a re-encoding threshold to optimize processing time and includes significant refactoring of the job runner architecture.

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Re-encoding threshold:** Introduced a `threshold_mb` setting (default: 20MB) to `ReEncodeSettings`. Video segments smaller than this threshold will now skip the re-encoding step, as re-encoding small files often provides minimal size reduction while incurring processing overhead. To re-encode all segments regardless of size, set this threshold to `0`.

**Code Improvements:**

- **JobRunner Refactor:** Refactored `JobRunner` and its subclasses to use `on_complete` callbacks. This decouples job execution from the pipeline flow, moving the logic for creating subsequent jobs into the main application logic.
- **Mutable Defaults:** Fixed a potential issue with mutable default arguments in `JobRunner` constructors. `stop_events` now defaults to `None` instead of `[]`, preventing the sharing of list instances across multiple class instances.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlippFuzz/ai-sub/compare/v1.9.2...v1.10.0

---

## v1.9.2

This release fixes an issue where video segmentation failed if the output directory path contained a percent sign (`%`).

**Bug Fixes:**

- **FFmpeg Path Escaping:** Fixed a bug where FFmpeg's segment muxer would fail or incorrectly interpret paths containing `%` characters (e.g., "Video 100%"). The application now properly escapes these characters in the output directory path, ensuring correct file generation.

- **JSON Formatting:** Added explicit instructions to escape double quotes within JSON strings to ensure valid parsing.

**Bug Fixes:**

- **Japanese Transcription:** Updated the prompt to strictly enforce native script (Kanji/Kana) for the `og` field when transcribing Japanese audio, explicitly forbidding Romaji.
- **Prompt Version:** Incremented `SUBTITLES_PROMPT_VERSION` to 2.

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/FlippFuzz/ai-sub/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0

---

## v1.8.0

This release improves the readability of output filenames by refining how AI model names are sanitized.

**New Features & Improvements:**

- **Model Name Sanitization:** Updated `get_sanitized_model_name` to replace non-alphanumeric characters with hyphens (`-`) instead of removing them entirely. This results in more readable filenames (e.g., `gemini-3-pro-preview` instead of `gemini3propreview`). Leading or trailing hyphens are now stripped from the resulting string.

---

## v1.7.0

This release implements standardized return codes for the application and refactors the main entry point.
